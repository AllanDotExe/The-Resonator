# The-Resonator
A 72-hour Game Jam project hosted by Murdoch University's CO-OP Game Development Club

A small town has been taken over by a unknown evil.

You, the Resonator, must purge this town of the evil that has claimed it.  Use your powerful sonic scream to shatter these brittle enemies. But your scream is not enough! Tune the tuning forks scattered around the map with your scream to ensure the termination of these unwelcomed monsters via the power of resonance!
